# Ajax

This is the repo for [Udacity's Ajax course](). The course covers making asynchronous requests using three different methods:

* the XHR object
    * <a href="https://ahelmi365.github.io/course-ajax/lesson-1-async-w-xhr/" target="_blank">XHR-Object: LIVE DEMO</a>
* jQuery's `.ajax()` method
* the Fetch API
    * <a href="https://ahelmi365.github.io/course-ajax/lesson-3-async-w-fetch" target="_blank">Fetch API: LIVE DEMO</a>

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each.
